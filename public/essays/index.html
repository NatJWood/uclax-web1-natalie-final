        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS, and JS.</h2>
        <p>HTML is the basis for a website. It contains all of the actual content on the webpage. CSS controls how that content looks, from colors to backgrounds to fonts. JS makes that content interactive. In our sun-moon example, javascript is waht makes that possible. Without JS, the webpage would have to refresh every time it changed between the images (and that's really impractical). JS can communicate with the server, sending and receiving information in real time, without having to reload sites.</p>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <p>SPAs load all content on one page, whereas multipage sites have links to other parts of the site. SPAs load faster, and executes everything client-side (through java). Because of this, SPAs are typically easier to develop and debug, as well as share to mobile apps. SPAs tend to be worse for SEO and also less secure (though according to the article I read both of these are getting better over time).</p>
