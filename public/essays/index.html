        <h1>Final Homework</h1>
        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS, and JS.</h2>
        <p>HTML is the basis for a website. It contains all of the actual content on the webpage. CSS controls how that content looks, from colors to backgrounds to fonts. JS makes that content interactive. In our sun-moon example, javascript is waht makes that possible. Without JS, the webpage would have to refresh every time it changed between the images (and that's really impractical). JS can communicate with the server, sending and receiving information in real time, without having to reload sites.</p>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <p>SPAs load all content on one page, whereas multipage sites have links to other parts of the site. SPAs load faster, and executes everything client-side (through java). Because of this, SPAs are typically easier to develop and debug, as well as share to mobile apps. SPAs tend to be worse for SEO and also less secure (though according to the article I read both of these are getting better over time).</p>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <p>A web designer is the person in charge of designing the look of a website. They handle graphic/UI/UX design. The front end developer implements those designs. They write the code to make the website look and function like the original design. Front end developers also make sure the site looks and functions well on many different devices and browsers. The front end developer handles everything client-side, in contrast to the back-end developer, whose work is solely on the server end. The Back end developer handles databases, servers, and other applications that the client will never see. They can also make behind-the-scenes upgrades or changes to improve the site's functionality. A web designer doesn't code, a front-end developer codes typically in html, css, and javascript; and a back-end developer typically deals with more advanced coding languages like Python, PHP, Java, or Ruby. </p>

        <h2>Final Project Idea</h2>
        <p>For my final project I would like to make myself a portfolio website for my photography. I'd like to have sections for both portrait work and fine art work, as well as a contact section. I'd also like to have an about me page. I'm choosing this because I would eventually like to have a live website to use for my portfolio, instead of the default adobe portfolio site I currently have. I'd like the pages to be a home page, portrait work, fine art work, an about page, and a contact page.</p>

        <h2>Define the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths.</h2>
        <p>Absolute paths are a link to a website outside of the current one. (www. google.com). Relative paths lead to a place in the same website. Site relative leads to another page on the same domain relative to root, and document relative leads to another place relative to the current folder.</p>

        <h2>What it means for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>
        <p>Agile is a process where the company works more simultaneously in short iterations, instead of the typical linear plan->design->develop->launch approach. Agile is very good for projects where the specifications and goals change frequently, as well as for getting a usable prototype faster. However, it does require the clients or stakeholders in charge of the specs and goals to be available for very frequent meetings.</p>
