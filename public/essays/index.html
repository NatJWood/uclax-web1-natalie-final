        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS, and JS.</h2>
        <p>HTML is the basis for a website. It contains all of the actual content on the webpage. CSS controls how that content looks, from colors to backgrounds to fonts. JS makes that content interactive. In our sun-moon example, javascript is waht makes that possible. Without JS, the webpage would have to refresh every time it changed between the images (and that's really impractical). JS can communicate with the server, sending and receiving information in real time, without having to reload sites.</p>
