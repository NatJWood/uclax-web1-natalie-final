        <h1>Final Homework</h1>
        <h2>Q1. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS, and JS.</h2>
        <p>HTML is the basis for a website. It contains all of the actual content on the webpage. CSS controls how that content looks, from colors to backgrounds to fonts. JS makes that content interactive. In our sun-moon example, javascript is waht makes that possible. Without JS, the webpage would have to refresh every time it changed between the images (and that's really impractical). JS can communicate with the server, sending and receiving information in real time, without having to reload sites.</p>

        <h2>What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <p>SPAs load all content on one page, whereas multipage sites have links to other parts of the site. SPAs load faster, and executes everything client-side (through java). Because of this, SPAs are typically easier to develop and debug, as well as share to mobile apps. SPAs tend to be worse for SEO and also less secure (though according to the article I read both of these are getting better over time).</p>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <p>A web designer is the person in charge of designing the look of a website. They handle graphic/UI/UX design. The front end developer implements those designs. They write the code to make the website look and function like the original design. Front end developers also make sure the site looks and functions well on many different devices and browsers. The front end developer handles everything client-side, in contrast to the back-end developer, whose work is solely on the server end. The Back end developer handles databases, servers, and other applications that the client will never see. They can also make behind-the-scenes upgrades or changes to improve the site's functionality. A web designer doesn't code, a front-end developer codes typically in html, css, and javascript; and a back-end developer typically deals with more advanced coding languages like Python, PHP, Java, or Ruby. </p>

        <h2>Final Project Idea</h2>
        <p>For my final project I would like to make myself a portfolio website for my photography. I'd like to have sections for both portrait work and fine art work, as well as a contact section. I'd also like to have an about me page. I'm choosing this because I would eventually like to have a live website to use for my portfolio, instead of the default adobe portfolio site I currently have. I'd like the pages to be a home page, portrait work, fine art work, an about page, and a contact page.</p>

        <h2>Define the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths.</h2>
        <p>Absolute paths are a link to a website outside of the current one. (www. google.com). Relative paths lead to a place in the same website. Site relative leads to another page on the same domain relative to root, and document relative leads to another place relative to the current folder.</p>

        <h2>What it means for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>
        <p>Agile is a process where the company works more simultaneously in short iterations, instead of the typical linear plan->design->develop->launch approach. Agile is very good for projects where the specifications and goals change frequently, as well as for getting a usable prototype faster. However, it does require the clients or stakeholders in charge of the specs and goals to be available for very frequent meetings.</p>

        <h2>Define the following roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Project Manager: they basically plan the whole project. They figure out the timeline, budget, risks, requirements, communications, and monitor each of these as the project progresses.</li>
            <li>Business Analyst: Business Analysts use data analytics to figure out how to improve and add value. They also handle business requirements.</li>
            <li>Scrum Master: responsible for facilitating the scrum process (agile-ish process). They help with managing the cross-department stuff that comes with scrum so that the team can focus on their own stuff.</li>
            <li>UX designer: they design the experience for the user, from conducting user research to creating prototypes.</li>
            <li>Web Dev: a programmer who codes web applications.</li>
            <li>QA tester: they examine and evaluate applications to make sure they function as intended and report any bugs they find to be fixed.</li>
            <li>DevOps: blending development and systems & operations, so that you are also designing for operability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>jpg: raster based, lossy compression. good for photos.</li>
            <li>gif: raster based, animated, lossless compression. good for animated stuff.</li>
            <li>png: raster based, keeps transparency, animated, lossless compression. Good for icons/graphics.</li>
            <li>svg: vector based, keeps transparency, animated, lossless compression</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?</h2>
        <p>Testing environments are used to test software in different environments before it goes live. Dev is where the devs test code as theyre writing it. QA is the where the code goes to be tested before it goes live. Production is the live server that people on the internet see.</p>

        <h2>Function vs Form: When are web images considered part of the content (HTML) as opposed to part of the appearance (CSS)?</h2>
        <p>HTML images are a fundamental part of the website, and if you removed it the user would be missing information. CSS images are purely aesthetic, and if removed the website might look worse but the user would still get the same information and content from the website.</p>

        <h2>What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?</h2>
        <p>Photo sizing can depend on many factors, such as browser size and screen resolution. You also have to consider load times, in that larger images will take much longer to load. Additionally, you also need to make sure that your photo isn't being sized over 100% because that can cause pixelation and not look good (vector images are different).</p>
